# FishyFalcon
A quad motor 3D printer board that supports spi or uart control on stepstick drivers and external driver functionality it is based around the STM32 Blackpill and the Pi Pico.<br />
###Features
      • SPI or UART on all 4 motors<br/>
      • External driver support through the AO3400 mosfet<br/>
      • Dual driver control through only 3 pins<br/>
      • Sensorless homing (not tested yet)
